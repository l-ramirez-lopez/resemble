#' @title Euclidean, Mahalanobis and cosine dissimilarity measurements
#' @description
#' This function is used to compute the dissimilarity between observations based on Euclidean or Mahalanobis distance measures or on cosine dissimilarity measures (a.k.a spectral angle mapper). 
#' @usage 
#' fDiss(Xr, X2 = NULL, method = "euclid", 
#'       center = TRUE, scaled = TRUE)
#' @param Xr a \code{matrix} (or \code{data.frame}) containing the (reference) data.
#' @param X2 an optional \code{matrix} (or \code{data.frame}) containing data of a second set of observations(samples).
#' @param method the method for computing the dissimilarity matrix. Options are \code{"euclid"} (Euclidean distance), \code{"mahalanobis"} (Mahalanobis distance) and \code{"cosine"} (cosine distance, a.k.a spectral angle mapper).
#' @param center a logical indicating if the spectral data \code{Xr} (and \code{X2} if specified) must be centered. If X2 is specified the data is scaled on the basis of \eqn{Xr \cup X2}.
#' @param scaled a logical indicating if \code{Xr} (and \code{X2} if specified) must be scaled. If \code{X2} is specified the data is scaled on the basis of \eqn{Xr \cup X2}.
#' @details
#' In the case of both the Euclidean and Mahalanobis distances, the dissimilarity matrix \eqn{D} between between samples in a given matrix \eqn{X} is computed as follows:
#' \deqn{
#'      D(x_i, x_j) = \sqrt{(x_i - x_j)M^{-1}(x_i - x_j)^{\mathrm{T}}}
#'      }
#' where \eqn{M} is the identity matrix in the case of the Euclidean distance and the variance-covariance matrix of \eqn{X} in the case of the Mahalanobis distance.
#' The Mahalanobis distance can also be viewed as the Euclidean distance after applying a linear transformation of the original variables. 
#' Such a linear transformation is carried by using a factorization of the inverse covariance matrix as \eqn{M^{-1} = W^{\mathrm{T}}W}, where \eqn{M} is merely the square root of \eqn{M^{-1}} which can be found by using a singular value decomposition. 
#' Note that when attempting to compute the Mahalanobis distance on a dataset with highly correlated variables (i.e. spectral variables) the variance-covariance matrix may result in a singular matrix which cannot be inverted and therefore the distance cannot be computed. 
#' This is also the case when the number of samples in the dataset is smaller than the number of variables. 
#' For the computation of the Mahalanobis distance, the mentioned method is used. 
#' On the other hand the cosine dissimilarity \eqn{S} between two obsvervations \eqn{x_i} and \eqn{x_j} is computed as follows:
#' \deqn{
#' S(x_i, x_j) = cos^{-1}{\frac{\sum_{k=1}^{p}x_{i,k} x_{j,k}}{\sqrt{\sum_{k=1}^{p} x_{i,k}^{2}} \sqrt{\sum_{k=1}^{p} x_{j,k}^{2}}}}
#'      }
#' where \eqn{p} is the number of variables of the observations.
#' The function does not accept input data containing missing values.
#' NOTE: The computed distances are divided by the number of variables/columns in \code{Xr}.
#' @return 
#' a \code{matrix} of the computed dissimilarities.

## History:
## 09.03.2014 Leo     The line rslt[is.na(rslt)] <- 0 was added in order 
##                    to deal with NaNs produced by the C++ code    
## 18.11.2015 Leo     Bug fixed. Code crashed When Xr was of one row  
## 18.07.2019 Leo     A bug in the scaling of the euclidean distances in fDiss was detected and fixed. The distance ratios
##                    (between samples) were correctly calculated, but the final scaling of the results was not properly 
##                    done. The distance between Xi and Xj were scaled by taking the squared root of the mean of the squared 
##                    differences and dividing it by the number of variables i.e. sqrt(mean((Xi-Xj)^2))/ncol(Xi), however the
##                    correct calculation is done by taking the mean of the squared differences, dividing it by the number of
##                    variables and then compute the squared root i.e. sqrt(mean((Xi-Xj)^2)/ncol(Xi)). 
##                    This bug had no effect on the computations of the nearest neighbors.
