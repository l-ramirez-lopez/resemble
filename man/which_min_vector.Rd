\title{A function to compute indices of minimum values of a distance vector}
\usage{
which_min_vector(X)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{a vector of distances}
}
\value{
a vector of the indices of the nearest neighbors
}
\description{
For internal use only
}
\details{
Used internally to find the nearest neighbors. 
It searches in lower (or upper) triangular matrix. Therefore this must be the format of the 
input data. The piece of code int \code{len = (sqrt(X.size()*8+1)+1)/2} generated an error in CRAN
since \code{sqrt} cannot be applied to integers.
