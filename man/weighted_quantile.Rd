\title{Compute weighted quantiles}
\usage{
weighted_quantile(x, w, probs = c(0.25, 0.5, 0.75))
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A numeric vector of observations.}

\item{w}{A numeric vector of non-negative weights, the same length as \code{x}.
Weights are normalised internally to sum to 1.}

\item{probs}{A numeric vector of probabilities in \link{0, 1},
giving the quantiles to compute (e.g. \code{c(0.25, 0.5, 0.75)}).}
}
\value{
A numeric vector of weighted quantiles corresponding to \code{probs}.
}
\description{
This internal function computes weighted quantiles of a numeric vector.
Observations are ordered, weights are normalised to sum to one,
and cumulative weights are used to determine the quantile positions.
}
\details{
This function implements a simple weighted quantile calculation by
sorting observations and applying cumulative weighted sums.
It is intended for internal use within the package and is not exported.
}
\examples{
x <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
w <- c(1, 1, 2, 2, 4)
weighted_quantile(x, w, probs = c(0.25, 0.5, 0.75))
