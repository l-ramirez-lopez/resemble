\title{Iterator for Grouped Subsets by Index}
\usage{
ith_subsets_by_group(x, y, kindx, kgroup, D = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A matrix or data frame of predictors (observations in rows).}

\item{y}{A vector or matrix of responses, same number of rows as \code{x}.}

\item{kindx}{A list or matrix of indices (e.g., kNN indices) used to form
subsets.}

\item{kgroup}{A vector of group indices into \code{kindx} to select for each
iteration.}

\item{D}{(Optional) A square dissimilarity matrix corresponding to \code{x}, used
to augment the feature set if provided.}
}
\value{
An object of class \code{isubset}, \code{abstractiter}, \code{iter} that yields, on each
call to \code{nextElem()}:
\itemize{
\item \code{x}: Subset of predictors (optionally prepended with local
dissimilarities).
\item \code{y}: Corresponding subset of responses.
\item \code{xval}: The test observation (optionally prepended with
dissimilarity vector).
}
}
\description{
Internal helper that returns an iterator object over subsets of \code{x} and \code{y},
grouped by precomputed index sets (e.g., k-nearest neighbors), with optional
dissimilarity matrix augmentation.
}
\details{
On each iteration:
\itemize{
\item A group of indices is selected using \code{kgroup} from \code{kindx}.
\item Corresponding rows are extracted from \code{x} and \code{y}.
\item If \code{D} is provided, the subset of the dissimilarity matrix for
the current group is used as augmented features.
