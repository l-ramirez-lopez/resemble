\title{Symmetric Euclidean Distance Matrix from a Single Matrix}
\usage{
fast_self_euclid(X)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{An \verb{n x p} numeric matrix where each row is a p-dimensional
observation.}
}
\value{
An \verb{n x n} symmetric matrix of Euclidean distances.
}
\description{
Computes the symmetric pairwise Euclidean distance matrix
from the rows of a single matrix. Only the upper triangle is computed,
then mirrored to the lower triangle to reduce redundant operations.

Squared distances are calculated first, then square-rooted. Tiny values
below 1e-14 are clamped to zero to ensure numerical stability.
}
\details{
This function is designed for efficient in-memory computation of full
distance matrices using only the upper triangle to avoid redundant work.
It applies the square root only once per distance and avoids unnecessary
writes to the diagonal (which is always 0). The implementation leverages
memory locality and avoids data duplication.

Suitable for moderate to large \code{n}. If OpenMP is enabled, the upper-triangle
loop can optionally be parallelized for additional speedup on multicore systems.
Note that the function assumes that the input matrix \code{X} is not empty and
