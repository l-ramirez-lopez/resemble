\arguments{
\item{retain_by}{a character string indicating how the training observations
to be kept at each iteration must be selected. Two options are available:
\code{'proportion'} (default) retains a fix proportion of observations at each
iteration and \code{'probability'} retains observations whose errors are
below an estimated percentile (cut point) from a given probability.
See details.}

\item{percentile_type}{if \code{retain_by = 'probability'}, an integer
between 1 and 9 to be passed to the the \code{type} argument of the
\code{\link[stats]{quantile}} function to estimate the percentile cut-off
value used to select the observations at each iteration. Default is 7
(as in \code{\link[stats]{quantile}}). If \code{retain_by != 'proportion'},
this argument is ignored. See details.}

\item{tune}{a logical indicating whether to tune the parameters of the
regression method (e.g. pls factors). If \code{TRUE} the parameters are tuned
by using cross-validation which is based on the \code{number} and \code{p}
arguments. Note that cross-validation greatly increases processing time.
Default is \code{FALSE}.}

\item{number}{an integer indicating the number of sampling subsets/iterations
for cross-validation. Default is 10.}

\item{p}{if \code{tune = TRUE}, a value indicating the percentage of
observations to build each group in the the leave-group-out internal
cross-validation (used for parameter tuning at each iteration). These groups
are built from the training subset selected at the respective iteration.
Default is 0.75 (i.e. 75 "\%").}

\item{verbose}{a logical indicating if some information about each iteration
must be printed.}

\item{allow_parallel}{set to TRUE to parallelise the internal re-sampling
and calibration. The parallel backend should be registered by the user.}
}
\value{
a \code{list} mirroring the specified parameters.
}
\description{
\lifecycle{maturing}

This function is used to further control some aspects of the \code{rslocal} function.
}
\details{
The training observations to be kept at each iteration can be selected by
using a fixed proportion of observations (in relation to the number of
observations in the training subset being used at each iteration) which
associated errors are the lowest, in this case the argument \code{retain_by}
must be set to \code{'proportion'}. This proportion (a value larger than 0
and below 1) is given in the in the argument \code{retain} of the
\code{\link{rslocal}} function.

For selecting the training observations, it is also possible to retain the
ones whose associated errors are below a percentile estimated for a given
probability (the percentile is estimated with the
\code{\link[stats]{quantile}} function). In this case the probability (a
value larger than 0 and below 1) must be provided in the argument
\code{retain}, this numeric value is passed to the argument \code{probs} in
the \code{\link[stats]{quantile}} function. This method might be useful in
the presence of outlier observations with considerable deviation in their
associated errors.

The internal validations for tuning the number of pls factors are based on
the leave-group-out cross-validation. Arguments \code{p} and \code{number}
are used to control the number of groups and the amount of observations
per group.
