Our aim with the `resemble` package  is...

## Memory-based learning (MBL)

MBL has proven to be a method to derive highly accurate predictions from large 
spectral libraries ([@ramirez2013spectrum])...

## RS-LOCAL

The RS-LOCAL algorithm was recently introduces by [@lobsey2017rs]...


## Neighbor search 

Neighbor search is used when having a dataset, it is necessary to identify/select 
its most spectrally similar observations from another dataset. This kind of subset 
selection can bee very useful when dealing with very large spectral 
datasets. ......

## Orthogonal projections (Principal Components and Partial Least Squares)

Perhaps this can go on another vignette document

## Dissimilaritry

Perhaps this can also go on another vignette document
