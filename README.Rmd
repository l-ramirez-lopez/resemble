Version: `r paste(resemble:::pkg_info()[1:2], collapse =  " \U002D\U002D ")`

## About
The `resemble` package provides high-performing functionality for 
data-driven modeling (including local modeling), nearest-neighbor search and 
orthogonal projections in spectral data.

## Vignette
A new vignette for `resemble` explaining its core functionality is available 
at: https://cran.r-project.org/package=resemble/vignettes/resemble.html

## Core functionality 

The core functionality of the package can be summarized into the following 
functions:
  
__`mbl`__: implements memory-based learning (MBL) for modeling and predicting 
continuous response variables. For example, it can be used to reproduce the 
famous LOCAL algorithm proposed by Shenk et al. (1997). In general, this 
function allows you to easily customize your own MBL regression-prediction 
method.

__`dissimilarity`__: Computes dissimilarity matrices based on various methods 
(e.g. Euclidean, Mahalanobis, cosine, correlation, moving correlation, 
Spectral information divergence, principal components dissimilarity and partial 
least squares dissimilarity).

__`ortho_projection`__: A function for dimensionality reduction using either 
principal component analysis or partial least squares (a.k.a projection to 
latent structures). 

__`search_neighbors`__: A function to efficiently retrieve from a reference set 
the k-nearest neighbors of another given data set.

## New version
During the recent lockdown we invested some of our free time to come up 
with a new version of our package. This new `resemble` 2.0 comes with MAJOR 
improvements and new functions! For these improvements major changes were 
required. The most evident changes are in the function and argument names.
These have been now adapted to properly follow the 
[tydiverse style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/). A number of changes have 
been implemented for the sake of computational efficiency. These changes are 
documented in `inst\changes.md`.

New interesing functions and fucntionality are also available, for example, 
the `mbl()` function now allows sample spiking, where a 
set of reference observations can be forced to be included in the neighborhhoods 
of each sample to be predicted. The `serach_neighbors()` function efficiently 
retrieves from a refence set the k-nearest neighbors of another given dataset. 
The `dissimilarity()` function computes dissimilarity matrices based on various 
metrics. 

## Installation 
If you want to install the package and try its functionality, it is very simple,
just type the following line in your `R` console:

```
install.packages('resemble')
```

If you do not have the following packages installed, it might be good to 
update/install them first
```
install.packages('Rcpp')
install.packages('RcppArmadillo')
install.packages('foreach')
install.packages('iterators')
```
__Note__: Apart from these packages we stronly recommend to download and install 
Rtools [https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/)). 
This is important for obtaining the proper C++ toolchain that might be needed 
for `resemble`.

Then, install `resemble`

You can also install the development version of `resemble` directly from github 
using [`devtools`](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=devtools):
  
```
devtools::install_github("l-ramirez-lopez/resemble")
```

NOTE: in some MAC Os it is still recommended to install `gfortran` and `clang`
from [here](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/tools/). Even for R >= 4.0. 
For more info, check this [issue](https://github.com/tidyverts/fable/issues/193).  




## Example

After installing `resemble` you should be also able to run the following lines:
  
```
library(resemble)
library(tidyr)
library(prospectr)
data(NIRsoil)

# Proprocess the data
NIRsoil <- NIRsoil[NIRsoil$CEC %>% complete.cases(),]
wavs <- as.numeric(colnames(NIRsoil$spc))

NIRsoil$spc_p <- NIRsoil$spc %>% 
  standardNormalVariate() %>% 
  resample(wavs, seq(min(wavs), max(wavs), by = 11)) %>% 
  savitzkyGolay(p = 1, w = 5, m = 1)

# split into calibration/training and test
train_x <- NIRsoil$spc_p[as.logical(NIRsoil$train), ]
train_y <- NIRsoil$CEC[as.logical(NIRsoil$train)]

test_x <- NIRsoil$spc_p[!as.logical(NIRsoil$train), ]
test_y <- NIRsoil$CEC[!as.logical(NIRsoil$train)]

# Use MBL as in Ramirez-Lopez et al. (2013)
sbl <- mbl(
  Xr = train_x, Yr = train_y, Xu = test_x,
  k = seq(50, 130, by = 20),
  method = local_fit_gpr(),
  control = mbl_control(validation_type = "NNv")
)
sbl
plot(sbl)
get_predictions(sbl)

[`resemble`](http://l-ramirez-lopez.github.io/resemble/) implements functions 
dedicated to non-linear modelling of complex visible and infrared spectral data 
based on memory-based learning (MBL, _a.k.a_ instance-based learning or local 
modelling in the chemometrics literature). The package also includes functions 
for: computing and evaluate spectral dissimilarity matrices, projecting the 
spectra onto low dimensional orthogonal variables, spectral neighbor search, etc. 

## Memory-based learning (MBL)

To expand a bit more the explanation on the `mbl` function, let's define 
first the basic input data:

* __Reference (training) set__: Dataset with *n* reference samples (e.g. spectral 
library) to be used in the calibration of spectral models. Xr represents the 
matrix of samples (containing the spectral predictor variables) and Yr represents 
a response variable corresponding to Xr.

* __Prediction set__ : Dataset with _m_ samples where the response variable (Yu) 
is unknown. However it can be predicted by applying a spectral model 
(calibrated by using Xr and Yr) on the spectra of these samples (Xu). 

To predict each value in Yu, the `mbl` function takes each sample in Xu 
and searches in Xr for its _k_-nearest neighbours (most spectrally similar 
samples). Then a (local) model is calibrated with these (reference) neighbours 
and it immediately predicts the correspondent value in Yu from Xu. In the 
function, the _k_-nearest neighbour search is performed by computing spectral 
dissimilarity matrices between observations. The `mbl` function offers the 
following regression options for calibrating the (local) models:

__`'gpr'`__:          Gaussian process with linear kernel.

__`'pls'`__:          Partial least squares.     

__`'wapls'`__:        Weighted average partial least squares (Shenk et al., 1997).

Figure 2 illustrates the basic steps in MBL for a set of five observations.
