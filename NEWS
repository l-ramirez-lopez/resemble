             suggestions.

             the 'wapls1' method has been implemented.

* 23.04.2014 Added default variable names when they are missing 
             and an error message when the names of Xr do not match
             the names of Xu.

             function when the spectra is not centred for mbl
* 20.03.2013 The function movcorDist was removed since.
             it was included by mistake in the previous 
             version of the package. The corDiss function  
             can be used in raplacement of movcorDist.
