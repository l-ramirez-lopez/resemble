# News for the resemble package

## Version 1.3 
<<<<<<< HEAD
=======
* 11.04.2020 The option 'movcor' for the argument sm of mblControl() is deprecated. The 'movcor' moving window correlations between
             spectra as dissimilarity measure. Now This option can be specified by using 'cor' as the method in the argument 'sm' 
             and passing a window size to the argument 'ws'of mblControl(). If 'ws' is not specified, the standard correlation 
             between spectra is computed.

* 27.02.2020 The argument 'resampling' in mblControl() has been renamed to 'number' for avoiding confusions with the 
             arguments of the new rslocal() function.
             
* 18.07.2019 A bug in the scaling of the euclidean distances in fDiss was detected and fixed. The distance ratios
             (between samples) were correctly calculated, but the final scaling of the results was not properly 
             done. The distance between Xi and Xj were scaled by taking the squared root of the mean of the squared 
             differences and dividing it by the number of variables i.e. sqrt(mean((Xi-Xj)^2))/ncol(Xi), however the
             correct calculation is done by taking the mean of the squared differences, dividing it by the number of
             variables and then compute the squared root i.e. sqrt(mean((Xi-Xj)^2)/ncol(Xi)). 
             This bug had no effect on the computations of the nearest neighbors. 

## Version 1.2.0001 (alma de coco)
* 13.09.2016 A bug in the computation of the Mahalanobis distance in the PLS space was fixed. 
             
* 06.09.2016 Thanks to Matthieu Lesnoff who found a bug in the predict.orthoProjection function (an error was thrown
             when PCA preditions were requested). This bug has been fixed. 
             
* 10.08.2016 A bug in plot.mbl was fixed. It was not possible to plot mbl results when the k.diss argument                       (threshold distances) was used in the mbl function.   

* 10.08.2016 Since the previous release, the "wapls1" regression (in the mbl function) is actually compatible with               valMethod = "loc_crossval" (in the mblControl). In the previous documentation was wrongly stated                    otherwise. Now this has been corrected in the documentation.

* 09.08.2016 the projection matrix (projectionM) returned by plsProjection now only
             contains the columns corresponding only to the number components retrieved
             
## Version 1.2 (alma de coco)
* 04.03.2016 A patch was released for and extrange bug that prevented to run mbl in parallel 
             when the gpr method was used.
* 19.01.2016 Now it is possible to locally optimize the maximum and minimum 
             pls factors in wapls1 local regressions.
* 09.12.2015 Many thanks to Eva Ampe and Lorenzo Menichetti for their 
             suggestions.
* 08.12.2015 A method for better estimates of RMSE values computed for 
             the 'wapls1' method has been implemented.
* 08.12.2015 The 'wapls2' method of the mbl function is no longer supported
             because of several drawbacks computing reliable uncertainty estimates
* 18.11.2015 Several functions are now based on C++ for faster computations.
* 23.04.2014 Added default variable names when they are missing 
             and an error message when the names of Xr do not match
             the names of Xu.
* 23.04.2014 plot.mbl draws now the circles around the actual centre
             function when the spectra is not centred for mbl
* 20.03.2013 The function movcorDist was removed since.
             it was included by mistake in the previous 
             version of the package. The corDiss function  
             can be used in raplacement of movcorDist.

## Versions 1.0 and 1.1.1
* 19.03.2013 Hello world! Initial release of the package
