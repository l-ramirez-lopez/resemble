# News for the resemble package
## Versions 1.0 and 1.1.1
* 19.03.2013 Hello world! Initial release of the package


## Version 1.2.0001 (alma de coco)
* 13.09.2016 TA bug in the computation of the Mahalanobis distance in the PLS space was fixed. 
             
* 06.09.2016 Thanks to Matthieu Lesnoff who found a bug in the predict.orthoProjection function (an error was thrown
             when PCA preditions were requested). This bug has been fixed. 
             
* 10.08.2016 A bug in plot.mbl was fixed. It was not possible to plot mbl results when the k.diss argument                       (threshold distances) was used in the mbl function.   

* 10.08.2016 Since the previous release, the "wapls1" regression (in the mbl function) is actually compatible with               valMethod = "loc_crossval" (in the mblControl). In the previous documentation was wrongly stated                    otherwise. Now this has been corrected in the documentation.

* 09.08.2016 the projection matrix (projectionM) returned by plsProjection now only
             contains the columns corresponding only to the number components retrieved
             
## Version 1.2 (alma de coco)
* 04.03.2016 A patch was released for and extrange bug that prevented to run mbl in parallel 
             when the gpr method was used.
* 19.01.2016 Now it is possible to locally optimize the maximum and minimum 
             pls factors in wapls1 local regressions.
* 09.12.2015 Many thanks to Eva Ampe and Lorenzo Menichetti for their 
             suggestions.
* 08.12.2015 A method for better estimates of RMSE values computed for 
             the 'wapls1' method has been implemented.
* 08.12.2015 The 'wapls2' method of the mbl function is no longer supported
             because of several drawbacks computing reliable uncertainty estimates
* 18.11.2015 Several functions are now based on C++ for faster computations.
* 23.04.2014 Added default variable names when they are missing 
             and an error message when the names of Xr do not match
             the names of Xu.
* 23.04.2014 plot.mbl draws now the circles around the actual centre
             function when the spectra is not centred for mbl
* 20.03.2013 The function movcorDist was removed since.
             it was included by mistake in the previous 
             version of the package. The corDiss function  
             can be used in raplacement of movcorDist.
